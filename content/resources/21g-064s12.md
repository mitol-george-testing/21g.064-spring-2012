description: In August of 1945, the United States dropped atomic bombs on the Japanese
  cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Memorials for the victims have been built all
  over the world. These bombings are still remembered today not just as events during
  the war, but as events that had a role in shaping modern Japan. Photo courtesy of
